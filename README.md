## To use it:
1. Download this repository as .zip file (click on green "Code" button below the name of the repository and select "Download ZIP").
2. Unzip xQML-master/ folder.
3. In ancillary_files/ folder, unzip mask.zip file.
4. Download transfer.zip file from the WeTransfer link I provided on Slack, unzip it and put it in the ancillary_files/ folder.
5. I recommend to install xQML package (see instructions below) in a separate conda environment (let's call it "xqml_env"). You will run the xQML_tutorial.ipynb in this environment.
6. Irecommend to create a different conda environment (let's call it "namaster_env") and install all packages required to run the NaMaster_tutorial.ipynb and Likelihood_tutorial.ipynb in this environment.
